Pigpio-sys
==========

Raw, unsafe bindings to `libpigpio`.

About
-----

These are bindings generated by bindgen, with no additional changes. See [`pigpio` library documentation](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/cif.html) to learn about the usage.

Changes to this crate are unlikely, but if you have some useful pull request, I will merge it. The crate is not stable (`1.0`) right now,
because I want people to try it out before marking it as stable.
